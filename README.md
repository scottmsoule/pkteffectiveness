# Pok√©Effectiveness

A simple .NET console app that uses the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to determine a given Pok√©mon's type strengths and weaknesses.

## üîç What It Does

You provide the name of a Pok√©mon (e.g. `pikachu`, `charizard`), and the app fetches its type(s) from the Pok√©API. It then displays which other types it is strong or weak against based on official Pok√©mon type effectiveness rules.

## Tech Stack

- .NET 8
- C#
- `System.Net.Http`
- `System.Text.Json`
- Pok√©API (`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}`)
